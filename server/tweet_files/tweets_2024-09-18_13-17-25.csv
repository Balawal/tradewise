https://nitter.lucabased.xyz/InvestorsLive,So far the COSM chart was absolute carbon copy regardless if your opinion whether you agree or not. The chart I posted early ended up being 4 cents off.  23.80 was todays high GLMD so far  and the COSM chart the HOD was 23.84.  So not going to sit here and debate if it was a good comparison or not we already got that answer by the stock itself.   Either way  similarities here on COSM and GLMD is fear of selling or in todays case the fear of covering in this case.   COSM had fear that the trade would be broken  HOOD ended up getting caught upside down losing 50 million  Like COSM likewise we had the fear of covering your shares on GLMD today because most brokers that abide by FINRA rules you cannot recycle the shares. Once you cover you have to re locate the stock. And the price was now .50share instead of .02 this AM. Yes some brokers allow you to recycle for now.  Also on the way that it went up from 81011 etc. was slow enough to keep shorts in w out forcing them out margin wise while forcing them to build into a position before each stuff move.  As we pointed out at @IUTraders each stuff move was IMMEDIATELY soaked.    THIS IS THE NEW TRAP    Right now theyre just collecting into 19.40s as I write this.  Anyway  then they put the jets on.   Couple that with guys afraid to take proper risk management due to fear of no more locates or unwillingness to pay .501share and here we are.  They also know coming off the recent TNON move that NO ONE will have balls to swing short over night if they create enough fear into close no matter what they soak today they can sell into the final few minutes andor AHs if they get stuck. They have upper hand today but I truly believe most of the bias today on short side was there because they feared not being able to get back in and re locate.   Best of luck  high risk trade. Be careful and trade em well., 22h,https://nitter.lucabased.xyz/InvestorsLive/status/1836121747856232857#m, " 5  2  1  32", https://nitter.lucabased.xyz/pic/profile_images%2F1810815034446282752%2FyZDTLudt_bigger.jpg, Nathan Michaud
