https://nitter.privacydev.net/elonmusk,NEWS @Neuralink has provided its first comprehensive update since successfully implanting its brain chip into a second human recipient.  Last month Alex the second participant in our PRIME Study received his Neuralink implant. Alex was discharged the following day and his recovery has been smooth. With the Link he has been improving his ability to play video games and began learning how to use computeraided design CAD software to design 3D objects. This marks another significant step towards providing a highperformance interface that will enhance the control of digital devices for people with quadriplegia to help restore their autonomy.  From the first moment Alex connected his Link to his computer it took less than 5 minutes for him to start controlling a cursor with his mind. Within a few hours he was able to surpass the maximum speed and accuracy hed achieved with any other assistive technology on our Webgrid task. Similar to Noland our first participant Alex broke the previous world record for braincomputer interface BCI cursor control on day one of using the Link. After the first research session concluded Alex continued testing the capabilities of the Link independently using it to play the firstperson shooter game CounterStrike 2.  Alex enjoys building things. Before his spinal cord injury he worked as an automotive technician fixing and tinkering with various types of vehicles and large machinery. Since then he has wanted to learn how to design 3D objects using computeraided design CAD software so he could work on projects without needing to rely extensively on his support system. However the level of control offered by his assistive technologies made this challenging.  On day two of using the Link Alex used the CAD software Fusion 360 for the first time and managed to design a custom mount for his Neuralink charger which was then 3D printed and integrated into his setup. We are working with Alex to increase his productivity with the Link by mapping intended movements to different types of mouse clicks e.g. left right middle thereby expanding the number of controls he has and enabling him to quickly switch between various modes in CAD software e.g. zoom scroll pan clickanddrag.   With our first participant Noland we observed a degree of thread retraction that temporarily reduced his BCI performance. The threads have stabilized and the performance of Nolands Link has since recovered  more than doubling the prior world record for BCI cursor control.   To reduce the probability of thread retraction in our second participant we implemented a number of mitigations including reducing brain motion during the surgery and reducing the gap between the implant and the surface of the brain. We discussed these measures in greater detail in our live update prior to our second participants surgery.   Promisingly we have observed no thread retraction in our second participant.
